# Efficiency through Diversity in Ensemble Models applied to Side-Channel Attacks -- A Case Study on Public-Key Algorithms --
The current repository is associated with the article "<a href='https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/909'>Efficiency through Diversity in Ensemble Models applied to Side-Channel Attacks</a>" available on <a href='https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/index'>IACR Transactions on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems (TCHES)</a> and the <a href='https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/909'>eprints</a>

Each dataset is composed of the following scripts and repositories:
- <b>ensemble_model.py</b>: provides the script to use the ensembling loss introduced in the article,
- <b>"dataset"</b>: contains the targeted dataset (should be provided by the users),
- <b>"trained_models"</b>: contains the targeted dataset (should be provided by the users),
- <b>"trained_models"</b>: contains the model trained by the users.

<b>As, the considered dataset is not publicly available, the users have to perform the ensembling loss on their own datasets.</b>

</b>Requirements:</b>
- <b>Python 3.6.9</b>
- <b>Tensorflow 1.8.0</b>
- <b>Keras 2.2.4</b>
- <b>Scikit-learn</b>
- <b>Numpy</b>
